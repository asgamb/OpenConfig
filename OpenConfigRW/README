Example: Implementing a NETCONF Notification Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to implement a NETCONF Notification stream. 

Two applications (notifier_builtin_replay_store.c and notifier.c) are
provided which implements either a a notification stream with built-in
replay support or with externally implemented replay support.

notifier.c keeps its replay log in memory for simplicity.  A real
external replay store implementation would keep the replay log on disk.

The notifications are specified in notif.yang.

In confd.conf, the stream 'interface' is defined, and the NETCONF
notification capability is enabled.

Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD and notifier by typing 

        $ make all start

    notifier_builtin_replay_store.c is now started in the foreground.

    Alternative: To start notifier.c do the following instead:

        $ make all start2

 2. In order to make the notifier program generate some notifications,
    hit 'y', 'u', 'i', or 'd', followed by <enter>.  (see notifier.c
    for details).

 3. In another shell, to query the stream information, type

        $ make query

 4. In the new shell, type

        $ make replay

    to replay all logged notifications, and continue with the live feed.

 5. Generate some more notifications as in step 2, and watch them
    arrive as XML in the new shell from step 4.

 6. In a third shell, type

        $ make subscribe

    to subscribe to the live feed only.  Repeat step 5.

 7. Ctrl-c to terminate the session when the notifications are
    generated.
